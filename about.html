      <p>The journey of a small dream creating a big impact.</p>

    <section class="our-story">
    <h2>The Story of Code Sparsh</h2>
      <p>
        Hi, I‚Äôm <b>Avinash Mishra, an 8th-grade student at Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalaya,</b> Siddharth Nagar.  
        Growing up in a small town, I have always been surrounded by people with big dreams but limited resources. As a child, I was fascinated by technology and its ability to solve problems and connect people. But as I grew older, I noticed something‚Äîtechnology wasn‚Äôt accessible to everyone.
      </p>
      <p>
        Small businesses in my area were struggling to adapt to the digital world. They couldn‚Äôt afford expensive solutions, and often, they didn‚Äôt know where to start. I knew something had to change. That‚Äôs when the idea of Code Sparsh started taking shape in my mind.
      </p>

      <h3>Where It All Began</h3>
      <p>
        My journey with technology started as pure curiosity. I remember the first time I saw a website and wondered, ‚ÄúHow does this work?‚Äù I started experimenting, learning from online resources, and creating small projects just to practice. What began as a hobby soon turned into a passion.
      </p>
      <p>
        But it wasn‚Äôt just about learning. I realized that technology could be a tool to make a difference‚Äînot just for me but for the people around me. In school, I was fortunate to have amazing teachers and mentors who encouraged me. They saw my potential and gave me opportunities to lead and grow.
      </p>
      <p>
        Being selected as the leader of the IT Club was a turning point for me. It wasn‚Äôt just a title; it was a responsibility. I worked with my friends and classmates to explore new ideas, solve problems, and even organize workshops to share what we learned. Together, we proved that when young minds come together, great things can happen.
      </p>

      <h3>Why Code Sparsh?</h3>
      <p>
        The more I learned, the more I saw the challenges people faced. I live in an area where technology often feels like a distant dream. Small businesses and schools don‚Äôt have access to the tools they need to grow. And even when solutions are available, they‚Äôre usually too expensive or too complicated.
      </p>
      <p>
        That‚Äôs why I started Code Sparsh‚Äîto bring affordable, easy-to-use digital solutions to people who need them the most. It‚Äôs not just about building websites or apps; it‚Äôs about creating opportunities. It‚Äôs about helping a small shop owner reach new customers, or making it easier for a school to manage their work.
      </p>

    <section class="team">
      <h3>The People Who Inspire Me</h3>
      <p>
        I couldn‚Äôt have done this alone. My friends‚Äî <b>Ayan, Irshad, and Aditya </b>‚Äîhave been with me every step of the way. Together, we‚Äôre building something that we hope will make a real difference.

      <h3>Our Mission</h3>
      <p>
        At Code Sparsh, our mission is simple: to make technology accessible to everyone, no matter where they are or what resources they have. We believe that small businesses and schools deserve the same opportunities as big corporations.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our goal is to bring digital solutions to the most remote corners, to the people who need them the most. Because technology shouldn‚Äôt just be a privilege‚Äîit should be a right.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="future">
      <h3>Looking Ahead</h3>
      <p>
        Right now, we‚Äôre working on projects that we hope will create a real impact. But this is just the beginning. Code Sparsh is more than a startup; it‚Äôs a dream to make the world a little better, one step at a time.
      </p>
      <p>
        I‚Äôm still a student, and I know there‚Äôs so much more to learn. But with every challenge we face and every solution we create, I feel more confident that we‚Äôre on the right path.
      </p>
      <p>
        To anyone reading this, I want to say: If you have a dream, don‚Äôt let anything stop you. Start small, but start. You never know where it might take you.

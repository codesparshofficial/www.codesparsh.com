Hi, I’m Avinash Mishra, an 8th-grade student at Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalaya, Siddharth Nagar. Growing up in a small town, I have always been surrounded by people with big dreams but limited resources. As a child, I was fascinated by technology and its ability to solve problems and connect people. But as I grew older, I noticed something—technology wasn’t accessible to everyone.

Small businesses in my area were struggling to adapt to the digital world. They couldn’t afford expensive solutions, and often, they didn’t know where to start. I knew something had to change. That’s when the idea of Code Sparsh started taking shape in my mind.

Where It All Began
My journey with technology started as pure curiosity. I remember the first time I saw a website and wondered, “How does this work?” I started experimenting, learning from online resources, and creating small projects just to practice. What began as a hobby soon turned into a passion.

But it wasn’t just about learning. I realized that technology could be a tool to make a difference—not just for me but for the people around me. In school, I was fortunate to have amazing teachers and mentors who encouraged me. They saw my potential and gave me opportunities to lead and grow.

Being selected as the leader of the IT Club was a turning point for me. It wasn’t just a title; it was a responsibility. I worked with my friends and classmates to explore new ideas, solve problems, and even organize workshops to share what we learned. Together, we proved that when young minds come together, great things can happen.

Why Code Sparsh?
The more I learned, the more I saw the challenges people faced. I live in an area where technology often feels like a distant dream. Small businesses and schools don’t have access to the tools they need to grow. And even when solutions are available, they’re usually too expensive or too complicated.

That’s why I started Code Sparsh—to bring affordable, easy-to-use digital solutions to people who need them the most. It’s not just about building websites or apps; it’s about creating opportunities. It’s about helping a small shop owner reach new customers, or making it easier for a school to manage their work.

The People Who Inspire Me
I couldn’t have done this alone. My friends— Ayan, Irshad, and Aditya —have been with me every step of the way. Together, we’re building something that we hope will make a real difference.

Our Mission
At Code Sparsh, our mission is simple: to make technology accessible to everyone, no matter where they are or what resources they have. We believe that small businesses and schools deserve the same opportunities as big corporations.

Our goal is to bring digital solutions to the most remote corners, to the people who need them the most. Because technology shouldn’t just be a privilege—it should be a right.

Looking Ahead
Right now, we’re working on projects that we hope will create a real impact. But this is just the beginning. Code Sparsh is more than a startup; it’s a dream to make the world a little better, one step at a time.

I’m still a student, and I know there’s so much more to learn. But with every challenge we face and every solution we create, I feel more confident that we’re on the right path.

To anyone reading this, I want to say: If you have a dream, don’t let anything stop you. Start small, but start. You never know where it might take you.
